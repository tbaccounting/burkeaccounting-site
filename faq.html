          <summary>What does it mean that BurkeAccounting is a non-CPA tax preparer?</summary>
          <p>
            It means BurkeAccounting provides tax preparation and basic bookkeeping services but is
            <strong>not</strong> a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm. BurkeAccounting does not
            issue audited, reviewed, or compiled financial statements and does not represent clients
            in IRS court proceedings. For situations that legally require a CPA, you will be
            referred to a licensed professional.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How does the pricing cap work?</summary>
          <p>
            Your fee starts with a base price (for example, $20 for simple W-2 returns). Then a
            small percentage of your tax outcome (refund or amount owed) is added, plus any
            complexity charges if your return is more involved. Regardless, the total fee for a
            single tax return will never exceed <strong>$270</strong>.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can BurkeAccounting help if I have self-employment income?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. If you have 1099 income, online gig income, or a small business, BurkeAccounting
            can prepare Schedule C and related forms for many typical self-employment situations.
            Very complex businesses or those requiring advanced entity tax planning may be referred
            to a CPA or tax attorney.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I upload my documents?</summary>
          <p>
            You can use your own Google Drive or Dropbox folder and share a secure link, or use
            another mutually agreed-upon secure method. BurkeAccounting will give you a simple
            checklist of what to upload (W-2s, 1099s, prior-year return, etc.).
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can BurkeAccounting give me legal or investment advice?</summary>
          <p>
            No. BurkeAccounting does not provide legal advice, investment recommendations, or
            representation in legal proceedings. Any general information provided is for educational
            purposes only and should not be relied upon as legal or financial advice.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What if my situation is too complex?</summary>
          <p>
            If your situation is outside the scope of BurkeAccounting’s services — for example,
            multi-state businesses, advanced entity structures, or complex IRS notices — you’ll be
            informed early and, where possible, referred to a CPA or other qualified professional.
