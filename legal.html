          <p>
            Any information provided by BurkeAccounting, on this website or in communication with
            clients, is for general educational purposes only. It is not legal advice, financial
            advice, or investment advice. You should consult a licensed attorney, CPA, or financial
            professional for advice specific to your situation.
          </p>

          <h2>Scope of Services</h2>
          <p>
            BurkeAccounting’s services are limited to tax preparation, basic bookkeeping, and
            general tax education within the scope of a non-CPA preparer. Certain situations may be
            outside of that scope. In those cases, you may be referred to a CPA, enrolled agent, or
            other qualified professional.
          </p>

          <h2>Accuracy & Client Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>
